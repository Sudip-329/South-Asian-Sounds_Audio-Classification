# South-Asian-Sounds_Audio-Classification

This repository contains the code for the research paper **"South Asian Sounds: Audio Classification,"** published at the 4th International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control & Information Technology (C3IT) in 2024.

The project focuses on classifying diverse South Asian urban and cultural sounds by combining **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** with a custom **1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)**.

## ‚ú® Key Highlights

-   Audio recordings are preprocessed and segmented into standardized 4-second clips.
-   Features are extracted using **MFCCs** to capture the unique spectral characteristics of each sound.
-   Classification is performed using a custom **1D-CNN (SAS-CNN)** and compared against baseline models like ResNet50V2.
-   The model was evaluated on two key datasets: the newly introduced **SAS-KIIT dataset** and the benchmark **UrbanSound8K dataset**.
-   High classification accuracy was achieved through 10-fold cross-validation:
    -   **99.78%** on the SAS-KIIT dataset.
    -   **94.26%** on the UrbanSound8K dataset.
